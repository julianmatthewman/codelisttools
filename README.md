# codelisttools

[Shiny app](https://julianmatthewman-codelisttools.share.connect.posit.cloud) for making and comparing clinical codelists.

### Codelist maker

Allows for the creation of clinical codelists for use in studies using electronic health records data.

-   Use the pre-loaded ICD-10 code browser or upload your own browser.

-   Specify searchterms and exclusion terms to build a codelist; the interface facilitates iteration.

-   Export the codelist together with the terms used to create it.

### Codelist comparison

Compare two codelists and look for any matches. You can get a codelist directly from the codelist maker or upload an existing codelist.
